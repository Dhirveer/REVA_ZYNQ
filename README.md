# Real-Time Object Detection Using Hardware-Accelerated CNN on Zynq FPGA

This project implements a real-time object detection system using a hardware-accelerated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the Xilinx Zynq FPGA platform.  

The system leverages FPGA-based acceleration along with the ARM processor to achieve efficient and low-latency object detection for embedded vision applications.
